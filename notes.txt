Gotta get a MFing MVP up!  Too much time wasted with CSS
1.  Ok so it seems like i have to stack the "boxes" horizontally
  -I only need to show the div with the roll button, the roll values boxes, and images if I want
  -So far im thinking one big div as the background and set that to image cover.
  -Two divs within that div for the player "area"
  -The two player divs will have a roll button

  //When above is finished, Start next upgrade to project//

  //Refactoring with React and User c omponenets in mind:
  1. Main component (body) that has:
      a. Component for Player 1
      b. Component for Player 2
      c. Component for Dice Display
      d. Component for  displaying Roll Results 
      e. Componnet to display Results.

    2. Expand database with more characters 

    3.  Should have animations!
